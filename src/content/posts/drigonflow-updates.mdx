DrigonFlow, my new video sharing platform! As of now, the platform is in a very early alpha.

## The platform

The platform is made to be a simple, less corporatized alternative to large scale video sharing platforms. 

## How its made

Although I do not intend to make the platform open source, I do want to be as transparent as possible while keeping the code private. In doing so, here is the current teck stack for DrigonFlow:

- Next.js (create t3-app)
- TailwindCSS
- DrizzleORM
  - Soon to be replaced by convex
- Turso
  - Soon to be replaced by convex
- PostHog (for analytics)
- Vercel (for hosting)
- Mux (for video hosting)
- Clerk (for authentication)

## The roadmap

I have a few goals for the platform:

- Make it as easy as possible to use
- Make it safe
- Make it work

### Full roadmap:

early alpha (early 2025):

- Video uploads for select users
- Video Viewing

alpha/early beta (late 2025):
- open account registration
- Ads
- Video uploads for premiun users

beta (early 2026):
- live streaming for premium users (on seprate site)
- comments, likes, and more

release (late 2026):
- Open Video uploads
- Open Live streaming

## Wait? 
### "Wait, I thought you weren't going to make it corporatized?"
I know, ads automatically make you think that, but I'm not going to be putting in a minue of unskippable ads. Only up to 30 seconds of skippable ads, still not ideal for you as a viewer, however video hosting and data hosting isn't free so unfortunately we need to pay for it somehow.

### "Wait, premium?"
I do plan to make a premium payment tier for the platform, ideally this will be around $5 per month. This would gain you ad free and beta access to features like video uploads and live streaming. I do not intend to make a lot of features that are only available to premium users forever.

## Why is video uploading not public?
A mix of money and the lack of a good CSAM solution for small platforms/independent programmers (most platforms like google's Child safety toolkit expects you to be an organization, not an individual). As of now I select the users I trust to upload videos and know wont abuse the platform.
